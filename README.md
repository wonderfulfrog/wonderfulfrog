## Hello! Ahoj! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Devin. I'm a creative developer in British Columbia, Canada. I specialize in the front of the frontend. I love working with design systems and motion.

I've been working professionally as a frontend developer for over 10 years.

Outside of work, I love music, gaming, accessibility, neovim, home DIY, and reading - to name a few hobbies.

If you'd like to learn more about me, check out [my website][wonderfulfrog].
